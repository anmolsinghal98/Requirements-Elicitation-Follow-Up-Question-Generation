Clinic finding,"Interviewer: Let's go into more details. We haven't talked about pricing. How would you let pricing affect your decision to get a treatment at a clinic.
Interviewee: Price is not a huge factor. If the price is too much, it will be concerning, but I think the environment is more important than price. If you are in the clinic, you have to be very comfortable and the environment has to provide a calming atmosphere.
Interviewer: Let's talk a bit more about the environment. How does the ambiance, or the environment inside the clinic, affect your visit to the clinic?
Interviewee: The clinics I've been to have a good environment, so you don't really feel very nervous in the clinic.","And can you explain more about what you mean by a good environment, like what specific things you're happy with?",What specific elements of the clinic's environment do you find contribute most to making it calming and comfortable for you?
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Okay. And. Do you have any go to restaurants that you frequent? 
Interviewee: Brunch at Theirs is great. 
Interviewer: Can you explain why do you like that particular place?
Interviewee: They have a great Sunday brunch. They have good discounts and also Irish coffee. Also, they let you sit outside. It's nice. Service is great. They have a good selection of big plates. Apart from that, I think one thing that's just nice is they allow Apple Pay. So Sundays when I get out, I want to get out without anything like with nothing but my mobile. So I can go somewhere else after the food. However, most places require me to have my wallet on me.",Have you had issues after you chose a restaurant that doesn't accept Apple Pay?,Are there any other features or services that you look for when choosing a restaurant besides those you mentioned?
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: What factors do you consider important while finding a doctor’s clinic?
Interviewee: The first thing that comes to mind while choosing a doctor is whether the ratings are good, so it's a big bonus if anyone among my close friends or family has had a doctor before and had a similar experience. If that's not the case, then the second thing that I do is Google the particular doctor clinics with good ratings, and if it's covered under my insurance, I'll just proceed with that particular clinic. Maybe the proximity to my place, but that is the least important.
Interviewer: So how do you decide what's a good rating?
Interviewee: I look for feedback, such as if the doctor has a good track record for curing patients without requiring too-many follow-ups. ","So you don't focus on the actual rating number, you are more concerned with the content of the review?",How do you weigh your personal recommendations against online ratings when they differ?
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: If a friend suggests a particular hiking trail, does that also factor into your decision when you're planning a hike?
Interviewee: Yes, definitely. If they recommend it, then I will definitely strongly consider it.
Interviewer: Okay, and then would you say that you will look it up on Google Maps or Apple Maps after the suggestion?
Interviewee: Yeah.",Do suggestions from friends help narrow down your search for hiking trails?,What other sources or tools do you use to gather information about a hiking trail after receiving a recommendation?
Apartment search,"Interviewer: How do you plan paying for the utilities in your apartment?
Interviewee: I pay once a month online. It's an automatic payment straight out of my bank account. For utilities like gas and electricity, I set up my own accounts and the payments are automatic.
Interviewer: Is there anything in the process of paying for utilities that you would like to improve?
Interviewee: In my case, the management company has its own portal that helps me pay for utilities, rent, and Wi-Fi. They set it up for me. However, I feel like that is usually the case in really fancy apartment buildings, which are very expensive for a lot of people.",Can you further describe the portal that you use to pay for utilities?,What features would you like to see in a utility payment portal to make managing your bills easier and more accessible?
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: How do you determine whether a restaurant gives good value for the price you're paying? 
Interviewee: I think I'm looking for the right balance between pricing and the portion size. So even if it is expensive, but it has a great amount of portion, I think I will consider that a good thing. But if it's unbalanced, like it has a great price but a very small portion or little portion, I don't like it. I think I will hate it.
Interviewer: Do you consider the restaurant's price range or affordability when you make your decision?
Interviewee: The price very much matters to me. I usually tend to go to very affordable restaurants compared to the expensive ones, because I don't like expensive restaurants.","Okay, do you have any strategies for finding good deals or discounts at restaurants? ",Interviewer: Are there any other factors besides price and portion size that influence your decision on choosing a restaurant?
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: How do you start searching for a clinic?
Interviewee: I look at something like a Google review. If the review is good, then I'll likely choose that, and I also check some information like distance using Google Maps to see whether it is near or far from my home. 
Interviewer: When you are looking at reviews, what do you particularly see about the clinic?
Interviewee: I look at the overall ratings, so if it's quite low, you probably don't want to choose it. If it's very high, like almost five stars, you'll definitely have a better inclination to choose that clinic. Apart from that, I'll probably look at those reviews that are not so good and see what kind of information they complain about regarding the clinic. Based on that, I'll make my decision.","Do you only rely on online reviews, or do you also take recommendations from other people?",Interviewer: What specific types of complaints in the reviews would make you reconsider choosing a clinic?
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Do you prefer hiking alone or with a group of friends or family?
Interviewee: I prefer hiking with a group of friends.  I had one experience hiking alone, and it was not very remote hike. I felt safe doing that, but apart from that one time, I've always been with friends.
Interviewer: What methods do you use to ensure that your hike is safe?
Interviewee: I hear many stories of people going missing, and I don't want to be one of those people. So if it's super remote, I prefer not to go alone. If a hiking a trail is not very popular, I'd be more cautious and maybe get some gear to inform people about my whereabouts, etc.",Have you had any safety concerns when you have gone hiking with your friends?,What kind of gear do you typically use to inform others about your whereabouts while hiking?
Apartment search,"Interviewer: Are you planning to share your apartment with a flatmate?
Interviewee: I moved here by myself and couldn't find anyone that I knew. It was hard for me to find a roommate, and I don't think I wanted one. I basically just didn't want to live with someone I didn't know.
Interviewer: Apart from not knowing the person, what other factors did you consider when choosing not to have a flatmate?
Interviewee: I guess someone who's not very clean or organized—that wouldn't be good for me. I like to have everything neat, especially my kitchen. I always clean up right after making food, and some people wouldn't do that. Or some people shave in the bathroom. I almost always had to clean up after my roommates, and I don't want to do that again.",Have you had any such experiences while sharing an apartment?,Interviewer: How did your past experiences with roommates influence your decision-making process when searching for an apartment here?
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: How do you see the quality of care provided by a clinic?
Interviewee: The clinics I usually visit don't do well simultaneously on all the three aspects of review, service, and price; there are trade-offs. Some clinics have excellent treatment but the price is also higher, while some might be very cheap but the treatment is not that good and you don't feel very comfortable. 
Interviewer: And would that play a factor in you going to the clinic again? 
Interviewee: I guess if you want to do general stuff, you can go to larger hospitals. They have all kinds of services, and usually when you go to a clinic, you're looking for something very specific. For me, I'm looking for something special, so maybe I prefer specialists.",Have you been to any specialist clinics in the past?,What specific qualities or services do you prioritize when selecting a clinic for your needs?
