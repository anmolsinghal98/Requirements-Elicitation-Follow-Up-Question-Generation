"I don't have the car, so I generally walk.",apartment finding,"Okay? And in case you had a call, would you consider on Route Parking? Or would you prefer if it's an apartment with you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one important factor for me is the public transport option because I don't drive and I myself don't need any disability accessibility I don't want to change buses to reach the clinic,clinic finding,okay so with respect to insurance are there any specific considerations that you would take apart from the fact that insurance need to cover your visit would the amount of copay make a difference for you when choosing a clinic  as an example you have a close clinic that you have to pay more on your copay and one that's farther away but it's covered 100%  which would you choose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I usually like to have a bit of diversity so I would not eat what I ate in the last couple days  the exception to that is I can always have pizza breakfast lunch or dinner and anytime even multiple meals a day Pizza is like you know an easy go to option but usually it's related to what haven't I had in a decent amount of time,restaurant finding,okay okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if that's not the case then the second thing that I do is I Google at the particular doctor clinics with good ratings and if it's covered under my insurance I'll just proceed with that particular clinic,clinic finding,OK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just having Apple pay help. Alright, It's more clean, but I am doubtful that's the common case.
",restaurant finding,"Yeah, so for ease of payment, have you had issues with choosing a restaurant? Like, I know some ones don't accept Apple Pay. So would that be a factor for you?
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just pay online once a month  it's an automatic thing  it's just like straight out of my bank account   and then utilities like Gas and Electric I set up my own account and like it's also automatic so I don't really have to do anything basically,apartment finding,is there anything else the process that you would like them to improve paying a utilities or something like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for clothes it really depends on the weather conditions how the weather is looking for the next probably a few hours
",hiking trail finding,"okay
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes depending on the weather if it's like a super sunny day I will go for a trail that has more tree cover,hiking trail finding,so also you did say depending on the day and weather you prefer tree covered so does that mean you're just looking for shade like if if it's sunny and you're not talking about other weathers like rainy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like my favorite type of restaurant is not like the fast food
",restaurant finding,"okay so you like something like a casual dining  got it oh all right so the next question is so you talked about you asking or you getting recommendations from your friends right when visiting a particular restaurant how much do online reviews and ratings affect your decision to go to a particular restaurant

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will not drive far even if it's like a pretty Trail,hiking trail finding,okay so is it you could say safety is pretty black and white that's something you would eliminate if it is not safe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was not going to have roommates in probably a studio. Might depend on how many people I can find.,apartment finding,"Okay, make sense. Okay? And laundry facilities. So do you mean, like in unit laundry? Or hmm, is it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You can like, do some research online, but also by just checking out the area. I think. Okay. So just checking out the area and see if we get a good feel about it.",apartment finding,"Okay. And you said, Bus, stop proximity and having a walkable distance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recommend no extreme weather because too much heat is bad too much of anything is bad but I have hiked both in the rain and in the snow with light rain and snow although I thought it will not be fun but actually it was really fun  I think the only tips would be to be mindful of your surroundings be very alert because one does not know what might happen and or what's there in nature like there are other animals which might be scared of us and always carry water,hiking trail finding,that's great I can see you shared a couple tips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah I also take recommendations from other people if some trusted friends recommend some clinic I also  ticket into consideration but I also look at the Google reviews as well,clinic finding,and which one do you give more weight like a friend recommendation or the Google reviews,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Landlord relation is pretty important.,apartment finding,"Okay. So is that if you have a bad landlord, is that a deal breaker for you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I take a car so parking's very important
",hiking trail finding,"got it okay what are some key safety precautions that you ensure while hiking like you know maybe carrying a map or downloading offline maps or just you know following the part that's been marked on the trail 
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Renewing lease is pretty important. I don't wanna have to look for any place of the year.,apartment finding,"Okay. And if you find a nice place, but they don't give you the option to renew.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Management is important. Just in general, good landlords, relations.",apartment finding,"Okay. Now, coming to the landlord itself, how important is it for you to have a good service in general with your landlord and a landlord who is pretty receptive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes well I decide whether a trail is long or short by how many miles it is  usually for state parks or even most of the parks in my city they have published information regarding how long one Loop of the trail is  I try to walk at least a mile at a time,hiking trail finding,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think no I just want to avoid the scary hiking trails with horrid stories a little and just be alert when I'm hiking because this kind of stories just scared me unnecessarily a bit,hiking trail finding,have you had any other scary experience is which might have put your stop to hiking or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reference is a big factor that's like first hand experience by my friends and family members so that would hold a lot of weight,clinic finding,Just for you would you put it before rating or searching on Google or after that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not like a social media person I don't see Twitter or Facebook or Instagram much so that's why I don't use those yeah,restaurant finding,okay so the next set of questions is going to be about the quality and service so what indicators or signs do you look for to assess the quality of a restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"usually just Google Maps Google weather I mean just the weather on the maps
",hiking trail finding,"okay what do you consider when you choose a particular hiking trail 
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I start search, online.",apartment finding,"Okay. Okay. And then let's talk about deposit as well. So some places ask you to pay a deposit upfront. So usually some places will ask for a maximum of up to one month's rent, and some places will have no deposit. So it does deposit, and how big the deposit is come into play when you are deciding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think I'm looking for the balance it was a bounce between the pricing and the portion so even if it is expensive but it has a great amount of portion I think I will assume that it's a good thing but if it's unbalanced like it has a great high price but very less portion or Little Portion I will hate it,restaurant finding,do you consider the restaurants price range or affordability when you make your decision or is it just the other stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like if the doctor prescribes like minimal number of medicines instead of like putting an extreme amount of medicines,clinic finding,OK then when you say minimal how do you classify something as minimal or not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't have any dietary restrictions like I can eat any meat or I can eat any vegetables I'm not even a veggie,restaurant finding,okay got it okay so the next section the next set of questions is going to be about recommendations and how you do your research on the restaurants how do you typically find about new restaurants or dining options do you usually use something like internet tools like Google Maps or Yelp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah I think I would just prefer the doctors if they wouldn't beat around the bush and just be honest to me step by step,clinic finding,that's good to know do you consider the professionalism is important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I typically think the Ambiance is more of like a plus that just adds to the place I don't know if I consider it unless there's only like two types of times when I'm looking for a particular Ambience one is like on a romantic date or something like that and the other one is a celebration like maybe I want more high energy but I think if it's just a casual meal or most of the scenarios the Ambiance is just like a plus but not necessarily like what I'm looking for when I'm trying to choose a restaurant on average,restaurant finding,okay and then I know we touched upon it but between choosing a new restaurant and something you're familiar with how do you make that decision,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe the approximity to my place but that is the least secondary,clinic finding,OK proximity  So about ratings and how do you decide what's a good rating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
