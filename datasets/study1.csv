Apartment finding,"Interviewer: What kind of things do you look for in an apartment when you are searching? 
Interviewee: I think location is the most important to me, like being close to my work or campus. Then there's pricing, and how big it is, like whether it's big enough to fit all my stuff. I think those are the main things.","So, the three things you are looking for are the location, the pricing, and the size of the apartment?",1,Confirmation
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Okay, and you mentioned that pricing was a challenge. Did you encounter any other challenges in the process? 
Interviewee: When I was looking to rent because of COVID, I had to basically make a decision based on just the videos of the places I was looking at, and I couldn't actually visit in person. But that's not really that bad.",You mentioned that you were looking for an apartment during COVID. What kind of means did you use to search for this apartment?,1,Answer probing
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Okay, so you would rank them as first for accessibility, second for safety, and third for parking space. What about roommates? Are you going to share your apartment with a roommate or flatmate? 
Interviewee: I moved here by myself, and when starting the Ph.D., I couldn't find anyone I knew. It was hard for me to find a roommate, and I don't think I want one. I basically just didn't want to live with someone I didn't know.","Apart from not knowing the person, what other factors did you consider in deciding not to choose a flatmate?",1,Answer probing
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Right, and you also mentioned the management companies. So how has your experience been so far with your management company?
Interviewee: The management's been really good. I always ask for help when something goes wrong, and they come in a matter of hours. They always fix it for me, and I've never had a problem with them ignoring me or any impoliteness. It's all been good.",Have you had any incident that required settling?,1,Answer probing
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: What kind of things do you look for in an apartment when you are trying to search? 
Interviewee: I think location is the most important to me, like close-ish to my work or campus, and then there's pricing and how big it is, like is it big enough to accommodate all my stuff. I think those are the main things. 
Interviewer: Three things that you are looking for: location, pricing, and the size of the apartment. 
Interviewee: Well, I guess size also includes the amenities, like does it have a parking spot outside; that's helpful too. I'm not too picky. I think the main thing was the main thing that was hard was like.","Okay, and the last thing that you mentioned that you look for in an apartment when you arrived in <anonymous>. What kind of experience did you have when looking for these four points?",3,Answer probing
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Yeah, so how do you plan out your utilities around your apartment? What kind of steps do you take to ensure that you're taking care of your apartment from a financial perspective?
Interviewee: I just pay online once a month. It's an automatic thing; it's just like straight out of my bank account. And then for utilities like gas and electric, I set up my own account and it's also automatic, so I don't really have to do anything basically.
Interviewer: Is there anything else in the process that you would like to improve, like paying for utilities or something like that?
Interviewee: Everything is all together. If it's my rent, the management company has its own sort of portal that helps me pay for utilities and Wi-Fi and all of that, and they set it up for me. But again, I feel like those are usually really fancy apartment buildings that would do that, and you have to pay the price for them. In <anonymous>, I just don't care enough, and you know being a grad student is not easy.",Can you describe this portal more?,3,Answer probing
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Yeah, so how do you plan out your utility payments around your apartment? What kind of steps do you take to ensure you are properly taking care of your apartment from a financial perspective?
Interviewee: I just pay online once a month. It's an automatic thing; it's just taken straight out of my bank account. For utilities like gas and electricity, I set up my own account and it's also automatic, so I don't really have to do anything basically.
Interviewer: Is there anything else in the process that you would like to improve, like paying for utilities or something like that?
Interviewee: Everything is all together, like my rent. The management company has its own portal that helps me pay for utilities, Wi-Fi, and all of that, and they set it up for me. But again, I feel like those are usually really fancy apartment buildings that would do that, and you have to pay the price for them. In <anonymous>, I just don't care enough, and being a grad student is not easy.
Interviewer: Can you describe this portal more?
Interviewee: The portal is like a really simple website, and I basically only use it to pay rent or something.","And when you have to make a maintenance request, do you have to call them, or do you use the portal?",3,Answer probing
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: What kind of things do you look for in an apartment when you are searching?
Interviewee: I think location is most important to me, like being close to my work or campus, and then there's pricing and the apartment's size, like is it big enough to fit all my stuff. I think those are the main things.
Interviewer: So, the three things you are looking for are location, pricing, and the size of the apartment?
Interviewee: Well, I guess size also includes amenities, like if it has a parking spot outside, that's helpful too. I’m not too picky. I think the main thing that was hard was...
Interviewer: Okay. And the last thing you mentioned, when you were looking for an apartment upon arriving in <anonymous>, what kind of experience did you have when looking for these four points?
Interviewee: For pricing, a lot of places that were good ended up being very expensive, but it's just about making some decisions based on the <anonymous> stipend, so it ended up being okay. Like, I'll just pay a little bit more for the location.","Okay, and you mentioned that pricing was a challenge. Did you encounter any other challenges in the process?",5,Alternative-seeking
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Okay, and you mentioned that pricing was a challenge. Did you encounter any other challenges in the process?
Interviewee: When I was looking to rent because of COVID, I had to basically make a decision based on just the videos of the places I was looking at, and I couldn't actually visit in person. But that's not really that bad.
Interviewer: You mentioned that you looked for an apartment during COVID. What kind of means did you use to search for this apartment?
Interviewee: Just sort of like, you know, my friends would tell me about a management company, and then I would just go to their website directly. I think I also looked at Zillow for renting, and that was helpful. But I didn't really use any crazy apps or technology all that much, it was just Googling.
Interviewer: So if you want to recommend someone to look for an apartment, what kind of resources would you suggest?
Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, Zillow. It's the only one I know of. It's experience or whatever it was good. Like I think <anonymous> is just easy to find a place because it's such a place. There are so many universities around, there are a lot of students, and so there are also a lot of places that are renting to students.","And yeah, to discuss more about the factors that you consider when looking for an apartment, how would you rank the neighborhood of your apartment? I think you can consider different things when looking for a neighborhood, like how safe it is, how close it is to a grocery store. How would you rank these things if you can think of any?",0,Topic change
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: And yeah, to discuss more about the factors that you consider when looking for an apartment, how would you rank the neighborhood of your apartment? I think you can think of different things when looking for a neighborhood, like how safe it is or how close it is to the grocery store. How would you rank these things, if you can think of any?
Interviewee: I would say the top ranking is how accessible it is to campus. So like, is there a direct bus route? Is it bikeable? So that would be location to work, like distance to work, which would be my top priority. Other than that, safety, I would say. But most areas in <anonymous> are pretty safe. There isn't really a big difference to me, safety-wise, between <anonymous locations>. In other cities, I would definitely say safety is really important. For the summer, I'm going to <anonymous> for an internship, so I would put safety as a top priority there because some areas are really not safe. After that, I would consider that some neighborhoods are really busy with a lot of restaurants or stores, but it's almost impossible to find good parking by your apartment.","Okay, so you would rank them as first, accessibility; second, safety; and third, parking space. What about roommates? Are you going to share your apartment with a roommate or a flatmate?",0,Topic change
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Do you prefer houses or apartments?
Interviewee: I mean, it doesn't really depend on the price. I feel like high-rise buildings are usually more expensive, but if all of them are the same price, I think I would prefer a building that's well managed. Like, it has a first-floor lobby with people to help me. That usually ends up being a bigger apartment building and not a townhouse.","Okay, and what kind of amenities do you think are absolutely essential when looking for an apartment?",0,Topic change
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Okay, and what kind of amenities do you think are absolutely essential while looking for an apartment?
Interviewee: Well, I guess things like water and electricity are really important, and access to good Wi-Fi. Oh, garbage disposal is important if the apartment does it for me, right?
Interviewer: What about in-unit laundry?
Interviewee: It would be nice to have in-unit laundry, but it's not that big of a deal. Like if there's just laundry on the same floor or in the apartment building, like in the basement that's coin-operated, that's okay as well for me. It's not that much money, so I think I'd rather save more money by getting an apartment without an in-unit washing machine because I feel like in-unit washing machines are usually a lot more expensive.","Right, and you also mentioned the management companies, so how has your experience been so far with your management company?",0,Topic change
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Right, and you also mentioned the management companies. So, how has your experience been so far with your management company?
Interviewee: Management's been really good. I always ask for help when something goes wrong, and they come in a matter of like hours, and they always fix it up for me. I've never had a problem with them ignoring me or, you know, any impoliteness. It's all been good.
Interviewer: Have you had any incidents that required setting?
Interviewee: Nothing big, just small things like my drain is kind of slow, so they come in to make it go faster to clean up the drainage.","So, it sounds like you're happy with the management company. What about your neighbors? Do you interact with them? Are you happy with how they live in your building?",0,Topic change
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: So, it sounds like you are happy with the management company. And what about your neighbors? Do you interact with them? Are you happy with how they live in your building? 
Interviewee: I don't interact with my neighbors at all, but they're pretty quiet. I've never had any problems with them. I say hi when I see them, but that's about it. It's easy and awesome.","Yeah, so how do you plan out your utilities around your apartment? What kind of steps do you take to ensure that you are properly taking care of your apartment from a financial perspective?",0,Topic change
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Yeah, so what about how you plan out your utilities around your apartment? What kind of steps do you take to ensure that you are taking care of your apartment from a financial perspective?

Interviewer: Is there anything else in the process that you would like them to improve, like paying utilities or something like that?

In <anonymous>, I just don't care enough, and being a grad student is not as easy.
Interviewer: Can you describe this portal more?
Interviewee: The portal's like a really simple website, and I basically only use it to pay rent or something.
Interviewer: And when you have to make a maintenance request, do you have to call them or do you use the portal?
Interviewee: I have to call the management. Sometimes I can email, but it's not as fast, so I just call.",Would you like to give any tips for someone who's looking for an apartment in <anonymous>? How do you think they should proceed with it?,0,Topic change
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Okay, so you would rank them as, first, accessibility, second, safety, and third, parking space. What about roommates? Are you going to share your apartment with a roommate or a flatmate? 
Interviewee: I moved here by myself and, starting the PhD, I couldn't find anyone that I knew. It was hard for me to find a roommate, and I don't think I want one. I basically just didn't want to live with someone I didn't know. 
Interviewer: Apart from not knowing the person, what other factors did you consider when choosing not to have a flatmate? 
Interviewee: I guess someone who's not very clean or organized—that wouldn't be good for me. I like to have everything neat, especially my kitchen. I always clean up right after making food, and some people wouldn't do that. Or some people shave in the bathroom. I almost always had to clean up after my roommates, and I don't want to do that again.","Right, yeah. Have you had any such experiences while sharing an apartment?",2,Answer probing
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Okay, and what kind of amenities do you think are absolutely essential when looking for an apartment? 
Interviewee: Well, I guess things like water, electricity are really important, and access to good Wi-Fi. Oh, garbage disposal is important if the apartment does it for me, right.",What about in-unit laundry?,2,Question probing
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Yeah, so what about how you plan out your general utilities around your apartment? What kind of steps do you take to ensure that you're properly taking care of your apartment from a financial perspective?
Interviewee: I just pay online once a month. It's an automatic thing; it comes straight out of my bank account. And then, for utilities like gas and electric, I set up my own account and it's also automatic, so I don't really have to do anything, basically.","Is there anything else in the process that you would like to improve, like paying utilities or something like that?",2,Alternative-seeking
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: Would you like to give any tips for someone who's looking for an apartment in <anonymous>? How do you think they should go about it? 
Interviewee: Like, ask previous tenants, my previous grad students, or people in the area before committing to a place because I think a good or bad management company makes a big difference. If you're unlucky and end up in a place like one of my friends experienced, their apartment building is falling apart, they don't get any help, and it's still pretty expensive to live there. I've learned about these situations just by asking them, and I think having a car is really important because I spent one year in <anonymous> without having a car and it was kind of difficult and annoying.","Okay, and again, can you imagine someone who's new and looking for an apartment? What other things should they keep in mind apart from what you've mentioned earlier?",2,Alternative-seeking
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: How do you start searching for a clinic? 
Interviewee: Something like a Google review. If the review is good, then I'm likely to choose that. I also look at some information like the distance using Google Maps to see whether it is near or far from my home. Yeah, I guess that's approximately the main stuff.","Okay, so when you are looking at reviews, what do you particularly see about the clinic?",1,Answer probing
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: How does insurance affect your decision to choose a clinic?
Interviewee: If there are specific insurance issues I need to take care of, then I look at that as well. If the clinic doesn't support my insurance, I will definitely not choose it.","How do you find out if a clinic accepts your insurance policy? What's your procedure for that, Pritam?",1,Answer probing
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: Do you have any experience of looking for a clinic with these requirements recently that you would like to share? 
Interviewee: I look at Google reviews to see which one is the best. I sort them, and if they are about the same rating, I'll just pick the one that is closest to my place. If it is too far away, then I'll compromise a little bit on the ratings and pick an optimal one that is closer to my home. I end up finding a clinic that is very highly rated and not too far from my home. I assess the quality of service given by the clinic. It's a clinic, right, so you have to provide good service. One aspect is whether their treatment is effective or not—that is almost the topmost priority. The other is whether you feel comfortable when you're undergoing their treatment. Maybe the third dimension is the pricing; at some clinics, the prices are super expensive, but some might not be that expensive.",How do you view the quality of care provided by a clinic?,1,Answer probing
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: How do you see the quality of care provided by a clinic? 
Interviewee: Usually, the clinic I pick doesn't do well in all three aspects of review: service and price, so you have to have some trade-offs. Some clinics have very good treatment, but the price is also higher. Some might be very cheap, but the treatment is also not that good, and you don't feel very comfortable.",And would that play a factor in you going to the clinic again?,1,Preference
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: How do you see the quality of care provided by a clinic? 
Interviewee: Usually, the clinic I choose doesn't do well on all three aspects: review, service, and price, so you have to make some trade-offs. Some clinics have excellent treatment but the price is also higher, while some might be very cheap but the treatment is not that good and you don't feel very comfortable. 
Interviewer: And would that play a factor in you going to the clinic again? 
Interviewee: I guess if you want to do general stuff, you can go to larger hospitals. They have all kinds of services, and usually when you go to a clinic, you're looking for something very specific. For me, I'm looking for something special, so maybe I prefer specialists.",Have you been to any specialist clinics in the past?,1,Answer probing
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: Have you had any experience in the past with payment plans for clinics? 
Interviewee: I think it might depend on whether you have seen a lot of pictures of thousands of dollars, where in fact it might not cost that much if you just have examinations or simple treatments. I'll say as long as it is about the same price across the entire industry, I'll be fine with that. Yeah, if it's like one standard deviation from the average price over the entire industry, that will be okay. In terms of pricing, the dentist and vision places I went to provide pretty reasonable pricing.","Yeah, so let's go into more detail since we haven't talked about pricing. How would that affect your decision, like how much it costs to get treatment at a clinic?",1,Answer probing

Interviewer: Yeah, so let's go into more details since we haven't talked about pricing. How would you let that affect your decision, like how much it costs to get that treatment at a clinic?
Interviewee: Price is not a huge factor. I mean, if the price is way too much, then that will be something concerning, but I think the environment is pretty important. If you are in the clinic, usually you have something, so you go to the clinic, right? So you have to be very comfortable, and the environment has to provide that atmosphere. It has to be ambient so that you can calm down and maybe get a better experience.","And yeah, let's talk a bit more about the environment. How does the ambiance inside the clinic affect your visit?",1,Answer probing
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: And yeah, let's talk a bit more about the environment. How does the ambiance, or the environment inside the clinic, affect your visit to the clinic?

Interviewee: Something like a Google review. If the review is good, then I'm likely to choose that. I also look at some information like distance using Google Maps to see whether it is near or far from my home. Yeah, I guess that's approximately the main stuff.
Interviewer: Okay, so when you are looking at reviews, what do you particularly see about the clinic?
Interviewee: I look at the overall ratings. If it's quite low, you probably don't want to choose it. If it's very high, like almost five stars, you're definitely more inclined to choose that clinic. Apart from that, I'll probably look at those reviews that are not so good and see what kind of information they complain about regarding the clinic, and based on that, I'll make my decision.
Interviewer: Great, and do you only rely on online reviews, or do you also take recommendations from other people?
Interviewee: Yeah, I also take recommendations from other people. If some trusted friends recommend a clinic, I also take it into consideration, but I also look at the Google reviews as well.
Interviewer: And which one do you give more weight to, like a friend's recommendation or the Google reviews?
Interviewee: I'm not sure how I weigh a friend's recommendation against Google reviews. Maybe something like 50-50, maybe half of the time friends, half of the time Google reviews.","Okay, and you also mentioned the second factor being location, so how does location play a role in choosing a clinic?",0,Topic change
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: How do you see the quality of care provided by a clinic?

Interviewer: And can you explain more about what you mean by a good environment? What specific things are you happy with?
Interviewee: Like maybe some decorations, like fine art, or a very soothing music. I guess these are very important things, and maybe a comfortable couch or something like that.
Interviewer: Right, and the tools that doctors usually use as well, right?
Interviewee: I'm not a medical expert, so I'm not sure how advanced your tools are, but at least they don't make me feel concerned. At least I think the technology is okay.","What about the technology that these clinics use? Do you think that affects your experience at the clinic? Like, if a clinic was to have some super high-tech instruments versus some that have very old, basic instruments, which one would you prefer?",0,Topic change
Clinic finding,"Interviewer: What about the technology that these clinics use? Do you think it affects your experience at the clinic? Like if a clinic was to have some super high-tech instruments versus some very old basic instruments, which one would you prefer?

Clinic finding,"Interviewer: Okay, and you also mentioned the second factor being location, so how does location play a role in choosing a clinic? 
Interviewee: If it is within walking distance or driving distance in a relatively short amount of time, maybe that would be a good choice.

Clinic finding,"Interviewer: Let's say you were to recommend a clinic to someone. What would you suggest they do to look for a clinic, and how would you recommend a clinic to them?

Interviewee: I like the beautiful views that one can enjoy at the end or somewhere during my hike.","Okay, regarding the beautiful views, do you recall any particular hike that you enjoyed a lot? Can you tell me something about it?",1,Answer probing
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: And what about the things you wear for hiking alone or with a group of friends or family? 
Interviewee: I prefer hiking with a group of friends, and it depends. Have you always been with friends, or have you had an experience hiking alone as well? I hiked alone once, and it was not very remote; I felt safe doing that. But apart from that once, I've always been with friends.","Well, you just mentioned safety, so what kind of methods do you use to ensure that your hike is safe, and is that a factor when deciding on a place to hike?",1,Answer probing
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Are there any other things you can think of that would make the hiking experience a bit better? 
Interviewee: Let me think about it. Also, another thing would be if people are hiking alone, there could be some kind of app that shows you how many people are near you who are also alone. You could just hang out with people and hike together if they are willing, so that might be a fun experience. Often, people do hike alone individually, but they might just want to go together.","Yeah, and how do you think we can use technology to make hiking better for us?",1,Answer probing
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Yeah, that definitely sounds interesting. So, would you be willing to participate in a program like this? Can you share any stories or experiences that you haven't had a chance to mention yet about your hiking experiences?

Interviewer: Any new things you saw?
Interviewee: I thought it was not a big deal; you can hike and rent gear and stuff for the hike, so I thought it was fine. It seemed like a little water, but suddenly people asked us to move away from the trail. Then there was a lot of water because these, I don't know what they're called, but suddenly there's an outburst of water, and many people have died because of it too. There are really scary videos on YouTube. It caused me to be more aware of the consequences of these nature hikes and the importance of being alert at all times.","I see, that sounds scary.

Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: See, that sounds scary. Have you had any other scary experiences? 
Interviewee: Just being tired and all, but nothing as scary as this one. I think 6 months ago there was a hike that actually progressed into the south of the canyon and the north of the canyon. The north of the canyon has way more water. Three months ago, a lady actually died of hypothermia north of the canyon, so I think just these data points surrounding the event also made it really scary for me.","Yeah, that definitely sounds interesting.

Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Okay, and this beautiful view thing—you recall any particular hike that you enjoyed a lot, and can you tell me something about it? 
Interviewee: Oh sure, there was a hike in the woods in California that I found really enjoyable. It was very strenuous; it was about an 22-mile hike, and after all the struggle, seeing the ocean and walking through the forest gave me a lot of joy. So I enjoyed that quite a bit.","So when you're going for a hike like this, what kind of things do you look for? What are the top things to consider while deciding on a place to hike?",0,Topic change

Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: What about hiking alone, or do you prefer going with the group of friends or the family?
Interviewee: I prefer hiking with a group of friends, and it depends on whether have you always been with friends or have you had an experience hiking alone as well I had one alone and it was not very remote. I felt safe doing that, but apart from that, I've always been with friends
Interviewer: well, you just mentioned safety, so what kind of methods do you take to ensure that your hike is safe and is that a factor while deciding a place to hike
Interviewee: yes I mean nowadays with so many stories of people going missing I don't want to be one of those people so if it's super remote I preferably not go alone like if I'm hiking a not very popular hike in the Yellowstone or something I'd be more cautious and maybe get some gear to inform people about my whereabouts Etc
Interviewer: and in your experience you've always been with friends have you had an experience hiking alone on remote hikes
Interviewee: the hikes I went on were really easy ones and not that strenuous or remote the one I went on alone was a very popular hike so there were quite a few people around me so I did not fear","Are there any locations you plan to travel to next?

Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Are there any locations you plan to travel to next? You mentioned Yellowstone or the popular hikes that you went to. So, do you have any locations that you're looking forward to? 
Interviewee: I'm going in the summer to the hikes in Yellowstone. Also, I plan on doing a simple hike; it's not that long, but it's a hike on the Upper Geyser Basin. I don't know if there's a specific name for it. I'm also planning on going to Watkins Glen on the East Coast, so that will be a short hike too.","And if you have to give any tips to someone, what kind of weather would you recommend when going on a hike?",0,Topic change
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Are there any other things that you can think of that would make the hiking experience a bit better?
Interviewee: Let me think about it. Also, another thing would be if people are hiking alone, if there could be some kind of app which shows you if there are people near you who are also alone, you could just hang out with people and hike together, if willing. So, that might be a fun experience because often people do hike alone individually, but they might just want to go together.
Interviewer: Yeah, and how do you think we can use technology to make hiking better for us?
Interviewee: Apart from that, maybe even in the app, you could have some kind of SOS button if someone is injured. But I understand the main hindrance here is the lack of network. I'm not sure if any of this is feasible, but at least at the trailheads, forming a group, I think, could be cool.","Yeah, that definitely sounds interesting.

Interviewer: Yeah, it definitely sounds interesting. So would you be willing to participate in hiking programs like this?
Interviewee: I think not. I just want to avoid the scary hiking trails with horrid stories and be alert when I'm hiking because these kinds of stories just scare me unnecessarily.
Interviewer: Have you had any other scary experiences that might have made you stop hiking or something?
Interviewee: I think it's important to be mindful of these things. If the local people hadn't alerted me, and other visitors there, of this outburst of water — the water was so low before that it was not intuitive to me that the outburst could happen there — so I think it's extremely important to be mindful of the possible risks, and then just move on and go on with the hike.
Interviewer: What would be your topmost recommendation apart from that?
Interviewee: I think to just start off easy because it's easy to get over. If you start with something like, I don't know, Angels Landing or something right at the beginning of your hiking experience journey, it might just be overwhelming. There are apps which classify hikes based on their difficulty level, so it might be worthwhile to find something easier to start with, enjoy the process, and then progress onto something more challenging.","And yeah, so would you like to recommend any place or any particular hike that you enjoyed the most to a beginner?",0,Topic change

Interviewer: What was the most outstanding part for you during the hike? 
Interviewee: I think the rock formations were really unique. It's an Upstate New York one. It's green, and there are these cut-out canyon-like rocks there too, and you essentially just hike along it. There's a waterfall there too, so I think it was really pretty, and it was easy enough. I could go there and come back, and it made me feel accomplished.

Interviewee: When deciding on a place to hike, I see how strenuous it is because I'm not an avid hiker. If it's too intense, then I don't go for it. I also consider how much sun and shade there is during the hike and what kind of views one might expect. Other things I look for are if there's nearby parking. Yeah, just about that, I guess.","To summarize, you look for easy hikes with good views, things like parking, and ease of access, etc. What kind of things would you avoid when you're looking for a place?",2,Question probing
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Yeah, you mentioned adding snacks and looking for good weather. What are the other factors you consider?
Interviewee: I guess there are some apps the national park services have for the major national parks to see if trails are closed due to snow or some other weather incidents. These are updated fairly frequently, but this does not really happen on other smaller hikes, like maybe in state parks or something, so that would be helpful to have. Another thing is, with so many people going missing over the recent past, I think it would be nice to have some kind of accountability, like some kind of geotagging or location-based tracking, for people who might be alone. Or, I mean, maybe when weather circumstances are not that great, but people are still hiking somewhere; that might just help with these accidents.",Are there any other things you can think of that would make the hiking experience a bit better?,2,Alternative-seeking

Interviewee: I think I told the manager I wanted the one on the top floor, which is, I guess, floor 28. The manager just kind of ghosted me for two days and then responded that the 28th-floor apartment is not available anymore. Then he tried to give me the 24th-floor apartment, which is the same price as the 28th floor, but two floors lower, which I'm kind of pissed off about because I want it as high as possible.",So how did you deal with that situation then?,1,Answer probing

Maybe proximity to my place, but that is the least important.
Interviewer: So you are focusing more on the content of the reviews rather than the actual rating number?

Interviewer: Okay, alright. And while you're searching for the apartment, let's say you have multiple options. How do you prioritize the search criteria based on different factors like maybe the location, the size, the amenities offered, or the pricing? Like, what are the different factors that you would incorporate in your search and how would you prioritize them? Got it. 
Interviewee: Okay, so perfect. First of all, I prioritize the price. I need to make sure that's affordable. The second one will be the safety. Basically, I search the crime map around that apartment. The third is probably going to be the interior, like if the apartment is new or old. For example, sometimes the washer and dryer are not included or not in-unit; you have to share it with the entire level or entire building. Another point will be amenities.","Got it, alright.

Interviewer: Okay, got it. So let's assume you have visited an apartment physically for a tour. Can you walk me through the process of how you would evaluate potential apartments, or how would you plan on making a plan to visit these apartments? 
Interviewee: First, it's just an email to schedule an apartment visit. Then, when I visit, I will pay attention to the neighborhood of the entire building to see if it's safe enough. When I enter the building, I will just look around, and typically the manager will introduce the amenities in the public space to you. Finally, when I enter the apartment, I will pay attention to the walls and the painting to see if they look good. But sometimes, they will just show you a sample room, which is usually furnished and pretty nice, so that's not too objective. Maybe one more thing is I typically prefer rooms where you can open the window to the maximum extent. For example, sometimes apartments don't have windows in your bedroom, and even if they have one window, you cannot open it too much. So that's something I will pay attention to, and that's something you will not be able to see or find out when you only look at their website or the floor plan, you have to physically interact with the window.","Yeah, makes sense, makes sense. Yes, okay. So the next question is, have you ever had any difficulty with the property manager?

Interviewee: because now I have the 24th floor instead of 28th floor I tried to lower the price by talking to the manager I didn't remember if the manager actually lower the price I think he didn't but I remember he offered me 6 months or 6 months free of parking so I got the parking free for half a year eventually yeah","All right, so just a follow-up or the next question: What are some key questions or, like, what are the important questions that you would ask a landlord or the property manager before signing a lease?",0,Topic change
Apartment finding,"Interviewer: All right, so just a follow-up or the next question. What are some key questions or, like, what are the important questions that you would ask a landlord or the property manager before signing a lease? 
Interviewee: So, I need to know if the utilities are included, if there's any, like, water or electricity. I want to know sometimes the apartment will handle electricity for you, like set up the account for you, etc. But in <anonymous>, I need to set up the account myself, and that's a super tedious process. I have to call to connect several times. Because I am an international student, they cannot verify my identity, and there's back and forth several times, and the phone line is super hard to pick up. Another thing I want to ask the manager is about the key fob. Typically, in my apartment, if you lose your key fob, you have to pay $400 for an extra one. That's super expensive, and that's a lesson I learned. Next time when I rent a house or apartment, I need to ask how much I need to pay or if the key fob is covered by the landlord.","Got it. So, the next question is about negative experiences that you had after you moved in. Let's say everything went perfectly, you signed the lease, and everything was great.

Let's say everything went perfectly: you signed the lease, and everything was great. After you moved in, you started having some problems in your apartment, maybe related to heating or water or something else. In that particular scenario, how did you handle the situation? 
Interviewee: One thing I remember about my apartment is that when you have your package delivered by either Amazon or UPS or whatever, the leasing office will take it for you. But you can only pick it up during their office hours. So after the office closes, you cannot access it. This is a pretty hard issue for people who have to commute to campus from morning to night. My entire commuting schedule, like my entire campus hours, does not overlap with their office hours, so whenever my package is delivered, I will not be able to pick it up unless I go back home from campus earlier than their office hours. That's one issue that's kind of bothering me all the time, and typically, there is actually no way to handle it except for what I said, which is to go back from campus earlier. I tried to talk to them several times, but their response is that they want to keep the package for you because it's safer. If you leave it outdoors, outside the building, it will be stolen or just lost. I can understand them, even though there are still scenarios where my package got lost or stolen by someone I don't know. So yeah, I think that's one thing that pops up in my mind.","Yeah, yeah, the next question is, what advice would you give to someone who is currently searching for a new apartment?

Interviewee: First of all, definitely reach out to set up the electricity account as soon as possible if the apartment does not cover that for you, because that process is super tedious and takes time. Also, look for an apartment with a window facing in a good direction, without other buildings blocking the light, because sunlight is rare and you need to value it. Capturing sunlight in <anonymous> can really improve your mood, so definitely look for an apartment that has good exposure and a spacious interior.","I got it.

Interviewee: Yes, I would like an apartment that is reasonably priced, not too expensive, and also not too cheap, because if it's cheap, then it's probably too old. I want good amenities, and especially if it has a swimming pool, that would be perfect. I want the utilities to be included; for example, the water, especially the water, should be included. I mean, water is something that an apartment should offer. Electricity is from a third party, so I don't expect that to be included. Oh yeah, one more important thing is the soundproofing. I want the apartment to be as soundproof as possible; I'm not a person who is very robust or insensitive to noise. Whenever there is noise, I cannot sleep well, so I want the apartment to be soundproof. I think that's pretty much it.","All right, perfect. That's it from my end.",0,Topic change

Interviewer: So, about ratings, how do you decide what's a good rating?
Interviewee: Yeah, suppose a doctor you're supposed to talk to has the relevant expertise in, say, doing a good job because, in most cases, doctors keep telling us to follow up for no reason.
Interviewer: OK, just to be clear, you're not focusing on the actual rating number; you are more focused on the content of the review, right?
Interviewee: The main criteria are getting cured and how quickly it happens. I would prefer if the doctor prescribes a minimal number of medicines instead of prescribing a large amount.
Interviewer: OK, then when you say minimal, how do you classify something as minimal?
Interviewee: Based on my experience, I've been to doctors who prescribe a lot of medicines. For instance, I once had a motorcycle accident where I wounded my hand, and some doctors prescribed me plenty of painkillers. In my opinion, this doesn't really help; it only works on the side effects instead of improving the actual condition. So, in instances like that, I would prefer if a doctor avoids such prescriptions. I believe that counts as minimal medicine.","OK, you also mentioned Google reviews. Can you tell if, on Google, is it the same criteria for Google reviews as well?",0,Topic change

Interviewee: Right now, as things stand, I believe proximity is a major factor because I don't own a vehicle. Yeah, like if the doctor is well-connected using public transport or even Uber, then that plays a huge role in me going to that particular doctor. 
Interviewer: OK, you first look at insurance and ratings, then you would consider proximity to shortlist which clinic you want to choose? 
Interviewee: Reference is a big factor; that's like first-hand experience from my friends and family members, so that would hold a lot of weight. 
Interviewer: Just for you, would you put it before rating or searching on Google, or after that? 
Interviewee: Only if I have a serious injury or a serious ailment, but overall I wouldn't give references much of a straight edge. 
Interviewer: So you will first categorize it as major or minor. If it is minor, you will look at the insurance and find clinics your insurance covers, then you look at the ratings, Google reviews, and the proximity in that particular order. If it is major, then you will put the ratings and Google reviews before you consider the insurance. 
Interviewee: Just based on my feeling, that's like if I feel my illness tends to fall a bit on the minor side.","Okay. Then, finally, just to repeat, for proximity, you consider something that is well-connected with public transport or a Lyft or Uber. You will consider that. Correct?",6,Confirmation
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Right. Yeah. And would you say you take risks while choosing a restaurant, like you want to try something really different or stuff like that, or do you just stick to these factors that you just mentioned? 
Interviewee: I do try out a lot of new places, and I'm okay with being disappointed sometimes. I don't go to a lot of new places, but sometimes it's like you don't want to expect very often that the reviews will be accurate, even on, you know, Google or from people, but they just don't sometimes match my preferences. That gets a little difficult.",Right. So have you recently had any such experience with a restaurant that did not turn out well according to your expectations?,1,Answer probing
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Okay. And do you have any go-to restaurants here in <anonymous> that you frequent? If you had to recommend them to someone, how would you?

Interviewee: Okay. Brunch at Theirs is great. Then there is Mkew. It has some good food. 
Interviewer: Can you explain any one of them, or why do you like that particular place? 
Interviewee: That restaurant's probably where I go most often. They have a great Sunday brunch. They have good discounts and also like Irish coffee. Also, they let you sit outside. It's nice. Service is great. They have a good selection of, you know, big plates. And also, it's pretty close to where I stay, so I can walk there on Sunday mornings. It's easy. It's also a nice walk. Hmm. Apart from that, I think one thing that's just nice is they allow Apple Pay. So Sundays, when I get out, I want to get out with nothing but my mobile. I can go somewhere else after the food. You walk or something, but most places require me to have my wallet on me.","Yeah, so for ease of payment, have you had issues with choosing a restaurant? Like, I know some don't accept Apple Pay. So would that be a factor for you?",1,Answer probing
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: What factors do you look for while selecting a restaurant?
Interviewee: So, what time of the day it is. What type of food I actually like eating, if I'm going with many people, few people, or alone. What the occasion is. How much I'm willing to spend. What I feel like eating, I don't know if I mentioned that, and what's open.
Interviewer: Okay. Yeah, sounds good. So, out of all of these factors, which one would you say is the most important thing?
Interviewee: What time and what is open are probably the most important.","Okay. And, do you usually search online, go on sites, and search about the restaurant before you make your decision?",0,Topic change
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Okay. And, do you usually go online, visit sites, and search for the restaurant before making your decision? 
Interviewee: I usually don't look at reviews, but I just look at the menu and rely more on that. 
Interviewer: Okay. And, do you rely on word of mouth, or do you use any websites if you have to look online? 
Interviewee: I usually don't look at reviews, but in the past, I think I have looked at just Google reviews. That's probably the extent of it.","Okay. Okay. Yeah, you also mentioned that mood is an important factor for you. So, what kind of cuisines do you prefer when you're choosing a restaurant?",0,Topic change
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: You're choosing a restaurant and you want to select a particular cuisine. How do you go about that? 
Interviewee: Okay. Yeah, this is very mood-dependent and also depends on whether it's lunch or dinner. For example, I would not go for anything Asian for breakfast, whereas if it's lunch or dinner, it's a very popular choice for me. Also, if I am meeting somebody, it depends. For someone I'm meeting casually or who I'm not very familiar with, I would probably not opt for American cuisine, which usually involves burgers and fries, or something that could be easily eaten with a spoon.","Do you have any particular recent experiences where you've tried looking for a restaurant? I mean, you can share either a good experience or a bad experience.",0,Topic change
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Right. And do you have any particular experiences recently where you've tried looking for a restaurant? I mean, you can share either a good experience or a bad one. 
Interviewee: I was really craving dumplings. I looked it up, you know, 'dumplings near me,' 'best dumplings in <anonymous>,' and got a bunch of options, but again, I don't know how trustworthy those are. I asked two of my friends as well. One gave me a bunch of places and told me what I could get at each place, so what would be good. And the other one had similar views, so for the one that matched, I just went to that place and had a good experience.","Great. Yeah, and going with the next part, how would you rate the following things when you're choosing a restaurant? So first would be the ambiance or the atmosphere of the restaurant.",0,Topic change
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Let's go to the next part. How would you rate the following things when you're choosing a restaurant? First would be the ambiance or the atmosphere of the restaurant. 
Interviewee: Ambiance mostly matters, but if the food is not good, I don't care so much about the ambiance. If it's an occasion, then I would definitely like the ambiance to be good. That's when it starts mattering more, unlike with the regular everyday situation.","Okay, and what about the service quality? Do you consider those things when choosing a restaurant?",0,Topic change
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Okay. And what about the service quality? Do you look at those things when choosing one? 
Interviewee: So it would depend on the time of day. I do a lot of breakfasts and brunches, and those are times when I'm most comfortable spending a little. I’m not very likely to spend a lot during those meals. But as for dinner, again, I might spend more. So, it’s very dependent on the time for me and also, again, the occasion and who I’m going with.",Right. What about seating differences? Do you look at that?,0,Topic change
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Right. What about seating differences? Do you look at that?
Interviewee: Yeah, I think seating's also super important to me. Comfortable seating, the option to be able to sit outdoors is always nice to have, and if they do have seating outdoors, do they have seating available? Also, if possible, I do not prefer sitting on chairs. I prefer booths or couch seating. So there's that.",Okay. So we just talked about the service quality. Same thing as the price range. Is there anything else that you can think of that would be a factor for you?,0,Topic change
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Ok. So we just talked about the service quality. It's the same thing as the price range. Is there anything else that you can think of which would be a factor for you? 
Interviewee: How well the menu is explained. Because sometimes you just have the dishes, and you don't know what it means. So it helps to have some sort of explanation if I need it. I am not a big fan of codes being used; it's just very inconvenient for me, at least. I also consider music or just the loudness of the place. I was somewhere last evening, and I could not hear what my friend was saying at all. It would be good if you could have a conversation, but the music was loud, like we noticed that everybody was trying to talk over the music. Nobody's really enjoying the music. So that, I think, becomes a big factor, like with the ambiance.","Hmm. Yeah. So, the next part would be, how do you make a decision when you have multiple options and you have to choose between a couple of restaurants? How do you go about making that decision? Because there's always a lot of restaurants to choose from.",0,Topic change

So, how do you go about making that decision? Because there are always a lot of restaurants to choose from. 
Interviewee: Right. I feel another thing I didn't touch upon earlier was distance. How long would it take to get there if I'm going to walk there, if I'm driving there, or if I'm using public transport? I think that becomes a huge factor as well. It's also this gut feeling that makes me feel like I want to go there.","Right. Yeah.

Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Right. Yeah. And would you say you take risks while choosing a restaurant, like you want to try something really different or stuff like that, or do you just stick to these factors that you just mentioned?
Interviewee: I do try out a lot of new places, and I'm okay with being disappointed sometimes. I don't go to a lot of new places often, but sometimes, like, you don't want to expect much. Very often, the reviews will be made, even on, you know, Google or from people, but they just don't sometimes match my preferences. That gets a little difficult.
Interviewer: Right. So have you recently had any such experience with a restaurant that did not turn out as good as you expected?
Interviewee: Yeah, so there's this restaurant in <anonymous>. Every time I kind of came across that place, it looked great from the outside. It looked dark, with these paralyzing lights. So, you know, it seemed interesting. So that looked like a place I wanted to go, and then each time I tried to go there, it didn't work out. So once I got a reservation, but they had to close the kitchen for something on their side, so my reservation was canceled. Then they're not open on Sundays, so I couldn't go there on a Sunday. And then when I finally did get a reservation and was able to go there, I got a bunch of things, but it didn't really. We didn't really enjoy the food, you know.
Interviewer: Cool. Yeah, so when you have such experiences, would you just cross out that restaurant from your list? Or would you give it another chance?
Interviewee: No, I'm never going to go back to that place again.","Okay. And do you have any go-to restaurants here in <anonymous> that you frequent? If you had to recommend them to someone, how would you?",0,Topic change

Interviewer: Yeah, so for ease of payment, have you had issues with choosing a restaurant? Like, I know some don't accept Apple Pay. So would that be a factor for you?
Interviewee: So I think sometimes if I'm aware of the restaurant not accepting Apple Pay, then I can go there. But if I don't know, it becomes a problem. I recently had such an issue. It was in school, and it was around 9:60. Places were already closing down. We placed an order and then realized we didn't have our wallets. So I went without dinner and had to go back home. That was an issue.","And is delivery relevant to you when choosing a restaurant for food delivery? Yeah, if you have experience with that.",0,Topic change
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: And is delivery relevant to you? Yeah, choosing a restaurant for food delivery, do you have experience with that?

Interviewer: So would something like time to deliver or location matter with that? 
Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, the time to deliver is the biggest factor for me. I usually prefer places I've already been to or ordered from, so I'm not looking from a larger pool, just looking at the same places over and over again. Whereas if I'm going out, I'm trying out new places.

Do you have specific factors such as pricing, portion size, ingredients, or overall dining experience? Like right now, you said the portion size wasn't really great.
Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I think I'm looking for the right balance. It's about the balance between pricing and the portion size. So even if it is expensive, but it has a great amount of portion, I think I will consider that a good thing. But if it's unbalanced, like it has a great price but a very small portion or little portion, I don't like it. I think I will hate it.
Interviewer: Do you consider the restaurant's price range or affordability when you make your decision, or is it just the other stuff?
Interviewee: The price very much matters to me.

Yeah, like they're sidewalk kind of trails, but sometimes I'm more than good for a sidewalk.

There are some parks that I go to that do have attached playgrounds, but they also have separate dedicated trails, so I will still go to those parks.

Interviewee: I've never thought about that, actually. I don't care much about it because I go to local restaurants if they look good. Well, yeah, but sometimes I also go to the global chains like McDonald's or Chipotle.","Yeah, do you take into consideration a restaurant's sustainability practices or commitment to using local ingredients when making a decision?",0,Topic change
Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Yeah, do you take into consideration a restaurant's sustainability practices or commitment to using local ingredients when making a decision?

Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Okay, you said, 'anything else that we haven't spoken about, but you want to add about your approach to choosing restaurants.' 
Interviewee: Yeah, they are not restaurants, but sometimes I go to local cafes by myself to study. So, in that case, the criteria would be a little bit different from restaurants because the main purpose of going to those cafes is to study, not for eating or for lunch or dinner. In that case, how quiet it is or if the environment is free really matters to me.","Okay, got it. Yeah, so I think that's pretty much it. Thank you so much for your time and thoughts on this.",0,Topic change
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Describe the process that you follow while going on a hiking trail.
Interviewee: I usually look up the trail in Apple, Google Maps, I will see how long it is. also if there's any online maps for the park at the park website. I wear appropriate clothing for the weather. that's about it
Interviewer: When you see you look up the trail in maps, how do you decide that this is the trail you want to go with
Interviewee: I look for trails at the parks that don't have kid playgrounds because I think those trails tend to not be as challenging. yeah like they're sidewalk kind of trails but sometimes I'm more than good for a sidewalk, especially if it's a hot day, then I will go for a tree-covered trail; versus sometimes I'll go walk by a lake  it's not a particular windy day 
Interviewer: So just a follow-up you prefer the trail to be in a park, or did you mean that it shouldn't be in a park
Interviewee: it should be in a park but not like a playground park there are some parts that I go to the do have attached playgrounds but they also have like separate dedicated Trails so then I will still go to those parks  but when I say Park I mean everything from like your  city park to State Park  I don't generally do trails that are not within parks  I like open and this Trails I like to do  those Loop trails  yes yeah
Interviewer: so also you did say depending on the day and weather you prefer tree covered so does that mean you're just looking for shade like if if it's sunny and you're not talking about other weather like rainy
Interviewee: well I don't do trails in the rain   I have been to a couple of one Trail in the rain but that was Trail model  I don't like getting wet, but my main concern here is the Sun","{'Speaker': 'Interviewer', 'Utterance': 'So you also talked about taking into account how long the trail is. Could you tell me how you decide if a trail is too long or too short?'}",0,Topic change
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: So, you also talked about taking into account how long the trail is. Could you tell me how you decide if a trail is too long or too short? Okay, okay. 
Interviewee: Yes, well, I go by how many miles it is. Usually, state parks or even most parks in my city have published information regarding how long one loop of the trail is. I try to walk at least a mile at a time. I go up to like four miles sometimes if I want to spend longer. I also know my average mile time, so I know exactly how much time it will take me to do a trail. If I want to walk for an hour or two hours, then I will go for like a smaller trail. I should do something like shorter trails and do a bunch of loops, bordering from walking alone. 
Interviewer: Okay, so you're saying you decide based on how much distance you want to walk and also on the distance you can usually walk, like what's your average? Based on that, you make that decision. 
Interviewee: Yes.","You also talked about websites. So, is it a very simple 'does it have a website, yes or no,' or is there more to it?",0,Topic change
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: You also talked about websites. So, is it very simple? Does it have a website, yes or no, or is there more to it?
Interviewee: Generally, if I'm trying out a new trail, I will prefer ones that have a website. I don't like going in blind unless it's something that one of my friends has been doing, and they're taking me. Generally, if not a website of the trail itself, then maybe like if some blog is talking about it, I will look that up. Preferred, highly preferred, like a government website, but I won't completely rule it out if it doesn't have one.
Interviewer: You're saying it's not an exact black and white, something you'll eliminate?
Interviewee: Yeah, mostly it's from, like, a safety standpoint. It makes me feel safer if I see pictures of it, and then I can always do satellite pictures, but I feel like actual pictures — they can be better for me to look at.","No, you also talked about the weather. So, I think I did touch upon it, but I just want to get some more clarity. You're saying you want the weather?",0,Topic change
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: No, you also talked about the weather, so I think I did touch upon it, but I just want to get some more clarity. You're saying you want the weather–you said maybe not rainy, but you're okay with hiking if it's too sunny. 
Interviewee: Yes. 
Interviewer: Could you also comment on the temperature? Does that come into play? 
Interviewee: Yes, it affects if I'm deciding to go out on my own, but I am pretty into walking. I've gone to trails when it's like 200° heat. I don't love it. I always have water and I have this water bottle holder for my hand, so I will just take water during trails. I do not like to go when it's cold and windy because it makes my throat hurt. I don't love that, so if I'm picking between extreme temperatures, I'll choose hot because then I can always get a covered trail. Usually, in the winter, the trees are bare, so they don't offer any protection against the wind.",Got it. So does the proximity also play a factor?,0,Topic change
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Got it. So, does proximity also play a factor?
Interviewee: Yes, if I'm just walking after work or I need to decompress, then I will pick a smaller trail. Even though it's really small, like a badly maintained trail, I have picked like 4.6-mile loops to walk on an average day. But I have also driven more than 22 miles or like 80 miles to do bigger ones, perhaps because they have elevation or points of interest along the trail, like overlooks. So it depends on what I'm looking for out of the trail.","Could you talk about suggestions from your friends? If someone suggests a particular trail, does that also factor in when you're planning a hike?",0,Topic change
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: When we talk about suggestions from your friends, if someone suggests a particular trail, does that also factor into your decision when you're planning a hike?
Interviewee: Yes, definitely. If they recommend it, then I will strongly consider it.
Interviewer: Okay, would you say that you look it up on Google Maps or Apple Maps after the suggestion?
Interviewee: Yeah.
Interviewer: So with everything that we talked about right now, you would still go through that, but you would just narrow down your search.
Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, or I'll be biased toward it if someone's recommended it, versus a trail that I've just happened upon blindly.",What about the safety of the trail? I think you touched upon that; could you elaborate on that?,0,Topic change
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: What about the safety of the trail? I think you touched on that. Could you elaborate? 
Interviewee: Yeah, I either go to state parks or I will always go with a friend, always during the day or overnight. If I'm going alone, I will go on a suburban open trail where I know there will be people, and I go in cities that are safe. For example, there's the very famous Katy Trail, but it touches upon areas I don't personally find safe, like downtown. It goes from downtown to very safe areas, or, you know, uptown for that matter, in comparison to the suburbs, so I will not drive far even if it's a pretty trail. 
Interviewer: Okay, so this is pretty black and white. There are some things you would eliminate if they are not safe. 
Interviewee: Yes, and I don't really have a quantitative or logical process for what I think is safe. There are also things that I find irrationally unsafe, but I just err on the side of caution. And yeah.","Okay, do you also factor in the network connectivity of an area that you're going into?",0,Topic change
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Okay, okay, do you also factor in the network connectivity of an area that you're going into? 
Interviewee: Well, no, but I feel like you've given me another parameter to evaluate future trails on. In general, I have been like, I expect when I go to state parks that my connectivity will be low. However, I am pretty good at using the maps that they give at the entrance; you figured out where I am at. I will always take those and actually save them, so that's like a 4-in-2 deal. Of course, I will have looked up the park beforehand, so I will already have information on where things are. I will also make sure to park my car near a restroom and always have a big pack of water in my car, and carry as much water as I need. My phone is fully charged. I do, but I generally also plan to always be done hiking before sunset. Regardless of when the park is open, most parks are open until sunset, some are open until five, but even the parks that say on Google that they open till 5:00 don't really have a gate, so I don't know how that works. State parks usually have a set-in time, but I never... Do you need me to repeat? Yeah, I can hear you.","Okay, got it. Do you also consider some types of wildlife or insights related to when you're deciding?",0,Topic change
Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: Okay, got it. To be also considered, are there some types of wildlife or insights related when you're deciding?
Interviewee: Yeah, in a sense, I know that most parks that are near civilization will not have as much untouched wildlife. Generally, I'm a pretty big bug-fearing person, so I know and I've suspected that state parks would have more bugs, and that is definitely true in my experience. But I just kind of brave it. That also means I don't go to state parks as often, but there are more factors to that than just the bugs. They're farther and need more time to do properly, and they also have entrance fees.","Okay, okay. I think I have what I need. I will summarize it once to make sure that I have understood exactly what is on your mind. Firstly, you start by looking it up on Apple Maps. You make sure that you prefer it to be in some park and that it does not have a kids' playground around. You prefer non-paved trails, so that means there shouldn't be sidewalks, preferably.

Hiking trail finding,"Interviewer: So when it comes to the proximity to the trail, you make that decision based on, like, I'll use the word 'mood.' For example, if it's a small walk, then you would prefer something nearby. But if you're looking for a bigger walk or something that has a good point of interest, then you're more open to a trail that is further away. 
Interviewee: Yes, also, it's usually the like a weekday-weekend thing. Yes, I will prefer closer trails.","Okay, so, though, would you be okay with the idea of going to further away places?",0,Topic change

Restaurant finding,"Interviewer: Okay, got it. Okay, so the next section, the next set of questions, is going to be about recommendations and how you do your research on the restaurants you are going to. How do you typically find out about new restaurants or dining options? Do you usually use tools like Google Maps or Yelp?
Interviewee: So, usually, I use Google Maps and like browsing. Actually, I can see the neighborhood and check reviews on specific restaurants to see whether they are good or not. Whenever I find something like a good restaurant, I just go there and try it.","Okay, do you rely on online reviews, word-of-mouth recommendations, or any other sources of recommendation?",2,Question probing
